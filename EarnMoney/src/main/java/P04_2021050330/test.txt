The dog ate my homework
Aliens abducted me and I did not have time to do all my homework
The zombie apocalypse broke out last night while you were sleeping I managed to conquer all of them but that left me little time to finish my paper on Shakespeare You can thank me for saving humanity by giving me an extra day to finish this assignment
A group of crazed homework thieves stole my homework
I was sick last night and threw up on my homework I did not want to gross you out so I can not turn it in yet
My homework turned into an amazing discovery Currently the patent is pending for it but I will turn it in as soon as that happens I would not want you stealing my ideas
